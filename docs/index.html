          <h1>About</h1>
          <p>
            Hi there, welcome to my web development portfolio! My name is Tapiwa and I'm a
            passionate coder who loves learning new technologies. I have been coding for
            two years and I have experience in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, Node.js and
            MongoDB. I'm from Zimbabwe and I'm 20 years old. <br /><br />I like
            contributing to open source projects because I believe in sharing knowledge
            and improving the web for everyone. Here you can see some of the projects I
            have worked on and the skills I have learned along the way. I hope you enjoy
            browsing my portfolio and feel free to contact me if you have any questions or
            feedback. Thanks for visiting!

          <h1>Projects</h1>
          <p>
            I am passionate about web development and I have completed several projects
            using TypeScript and Next.js. These are two of my favorite technologies
            because they allow me to create fast, scalable and reliable web applications.
            I have learned a lot from these projects, such as how to use hooks, dynamic
            routing, server-side rendering and API routes. I also gained experience in
            working with different databases, authentication systems and deployment
            platforms. I am always eager to learn new skills and improve my existing ones.
            I want to make more projects that showcase my abilities and challenge me to
            grow as a web developer.

            <h3>weather forecast app</h3>
            <p>
              A simple and elegant web application that displays the current weather
              conditions and forecasts for any location in the world. It uses a
              third-party API from OpenWeatherMap to fetch the weather data, and it is
              built using JavaScript, HTML and CSS. WeatherApp allows you to customize
              your preferences, such as units, language and theme, and it also supports
              geolocation to automatically detect your location. Whether you need to plan
              your day, your trip or your wardrobe, WeatherApp is the perfect tool for
              you.
