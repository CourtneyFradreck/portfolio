          <h1>About</h1>
          <p>
            Hi there, welcome to my web development portfolio! My name is Tapiwa and I'm a
            passionate coder who loves learning new technologies. I have been coding for 2
            years and I have experience in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, Node.js and
            MongoDB. I'm from Zimbabwe and I'm 20 years old.<br /><br />
            I like contributing to open source projects because I believe in sharing
            knowledge and improving the web for everyone. Here you can see some of the
            projects I have worked on and the skills I have learned along the way. I hope
            you enjoy browsing my portfolio and feel free to contact me if you have any
            questions or feedback. Thanks for visiting!

          <h1>Hobbies</h1>
          <p>
            When I'm not working on my projects, I enjoy spending my free time on various
            hobbies that keep me entertained and inspired. One of them is gaming, which I
            find relaxing and fun. I play different genres of games, from action-adventure
            to puzzle-solving, and sometimes I stream my gameplay online. Another hobby of
            mine is graphics and motion design, which I do as a part-time freelancer.
            <br /><br />I love creating eye-catching visuals and animations for different
            clients and purposes, such as logos, posters, videos, etc. I also like
            watching anime, especially the long-running series One Piece. I admire the
            creativity and storytelling of the anime, and I follow the adventures of the
            Straw Hat Pirates with great interest.

          <h1>Experience</h1>
          <p>
            I have been coding for two years and have gained valuable experience in
            various open source projects. One of them is Code Racer, a web-based game that
            challenges players to write code faster and more accurately than their
            opponents. I helped improve the user interface and the scoring system of the
            game. Another project I contributed to is SlateJS, a library for building rich
            text editors. <br />
            <br />I worked on several issues related to the formatting and rendering of
            the editor, such as adding support for tables, lists and images, fixing bugs
            with undo and redo operations, and optimizing the performance of the editor. I
            am also working on my own start-up company for a Bible note-taking app that
            allows users to create, organize and share their notes on the Scripture. I am
            responsible for designing and developing the front-end and back-end of the app
            using React, Node.js and MongoDB.
